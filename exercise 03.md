## Numberical Approach:
According to the question, we can get :

According to Taylor Formula:

put  it into (1.9):
## Source code:
for the specific code
![]()
## Result analysis and conclusion:
![]()
From the result, we can get that the x is proportional to time t.And the analytical result is

Bring the initial condition x=0  and t=0 into (1) 
 We can get  C=0
 So we can get ananlytical result

 We will find it match with the figure greatly! And the result we get from the Euler method is equal to the analytical result.
