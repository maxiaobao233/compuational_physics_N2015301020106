# Problem 3.31
## Abstract
Study the behavior for other types of tables. One interesting possibility is a square table with a circular interior wall located either 
in the center, or slightly off-center. Another possibility is an elliptical table 
## Method 
We consider a problem of a ball moving without friction on a perfect billiard table.Between collisions the velocity is constant so we have

After locatingthe collision point,We must next obtain the unit vector normal to the wall at the point of collision, n.It is then useful to calculate the components of vi parallel and perpendicular to the wall.These are just

Hence,the velocity after reflection from the wall is
